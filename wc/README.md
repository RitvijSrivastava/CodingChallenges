# wc

wc counts lines, words, runes, and bytes in the named files, or in the standard input if no file is named. A word is a maximal string of characters delimited by spaces, tabs or newlines. If no file/files are present then the command will read from Stdin.

Flags:

```
  -c, --bytes   print the byte counts
  -m, --chars   print the character counts
  -h, --help    help for wc
  -l, --lines   print the newline counts
  -w, --words   print the word counts
```
